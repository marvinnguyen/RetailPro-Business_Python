# Python Text Analytics & Sentiment Analysis Project

This project applies Python-based text analytics to analyse large-scale review data and extract insights about user sentiment and recurring themes. The analysis demonstrates how unstructured text data can be cleaned, processed, and modelled to support data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyse textual review data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The work focuses on transforming raw text into structured insights through sentiment analysis and topic modelling, followed by interpretation of results in a business context.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and pre-processed raw text data using Python
- Performed exploratory analysis on review volume and patterns
- Applied sentiment analysis to classify reviews by polarity
- Built topic models to identify key themes within the text data
- Evaluated model quality to select appropriate parameters
- Interpreted findings and summarised insights in a structured report

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- gensim
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic modelling
- Analytical reasoning and interpretation
- Communicating insights through written reporting

This project demonstrates my ability to use Python for applied analytics beyond basic data analysis, particularly in working with unstructured text data.
